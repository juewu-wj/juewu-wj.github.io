I am an incoming assistant professor in Higher Education at the University of Florida. I am a mixed-method educational researcher with both qualitative and quantitative trainings. My research interests lie primarily in diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) higher education, from the perspectives of learning sciences, organizational change, and social psychology. 

I am currently conducting my postdoctoral research at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu), working with [Dr. Rodolfo Mendoza-Denton](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/rodolfo-mendoza-denton). Previously, I completed my doctorate in [Learning Sciences](https://sesp.northwestern.edu/graduate-professional/learning-sciences/) at [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. David Uttal](https://psychology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/profiles/david-uttal.html). I also received a master's degree in Learning Sciences, a master's degree in Statistics, and a Cognitive Science certificate from [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu).
